# ***County Public Health Data Set Repository***

The County Public Health Data Set is a data set with a provenance of information collected in 2014-2015 examining the public health (physical, mental, environmental, and external factors) for all counties in every state within the United States. 

The purpose is to display the differences and similarities in physical health data of residents between multiple counties (within a narrowed range - same state, start with "C", etc), allowing analysis for further research investigating each respective county. 

The data's potential uses:
- Scientific analysis of the specific cut data
- Viewable trend of physical health based on county
- Conducting research to understand variations/comparibility
- Form long-term possible solutions (location dependent)
- Visualize results
- Generate public health models 

### **Getting Started**
---
The repository contains four total files - the README file, Feeder 3.1 (procedure for creating data subset), the original County Public Health Data, and the smaller-subset of the County Public Health Data. You can get started by interacting with the repository to use the subset or by re-createing the methods employed to create the subset.  

***To interact with the repository and use the subset data:***

1. Click the following link or access CountyHealthData (smaller subset) within the repository

https://github.com/srihithaavaidya/Unit-3-Project/blob/bd26eed9eb1d796ee50193cc30f598fe5be81254/CountyHealthData%20(smaller%20subset).numbers

2. Press the "..." at the top right corner

3. Click "download"

***To re-create the computational methods employed to create the subset:***

1. Click the following link or access Feeder 3.1 within the repository

https://github.com/srihithaavaidya/Unit-3-Project/blob/5120453a0d9097d0258e71285de12b6e6f174fec/Feeder_3_1.ipynb 

2. Follow the steps in the Feeder to re-create the subset (note: the original csv file can be downloaded from the Feeder or via the link below/from the repository)
